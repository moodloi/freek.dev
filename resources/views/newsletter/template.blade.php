Hi there!

Welcome to the {{ $editionNumber }} freek.dev newsletter!

Here are a couple of links I hope you'll enjoy as much as I did.

@foreach($recentPosts as $post)
@if ($post->original_content)⭐ @endif[{!! html_entity_decode($post->title)  !!}]({{ $post->promotional_url }})<br/>
{!! html_entity_decode($post->newsletter_excerpt) !!}

@endforeach

<br />

@if(count($communityLinks))
# Community links

In this section you'll find links submitted by others. [Let me know](https://freek.dev/community) if you did write or stumbled across a blog post, tutorial or video that might be interesting to appear in this section

@foreach($communityLinks as $link)
[{!! html_entity_decode($link->title) !!}]({{ $link->url }}) (submitted by {{ $link->user->name }})

@endforeach
@endif

<br />

@if (count($oldPosts))
# Old posts

Here are a couple of links from a while ago!

@foreach($oldPosts as $post)
[{!! html_entity_decode($post->title) !!}]({{ $post->promotional_url }})

@endforeach
@endif
